# Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision
A Python-based project that leverages computer vision and deep learning to recognize and interpret sign language gestures in real time. This system aims to bridge the communication gap by translating sign language into text or speech, enabling smoother interactions with the hearing-impaired community.
