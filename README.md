# Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision
A Python-based project that leverages computer vision and deep learning to recognize and interpret sign language gestures in real time. This system aims to bridge the communication gap by translating sign language into text or speech, enabling smoother interactions with the hearing-impaired community.

Features
Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Detect and interpret sign language gestures from live video feeds.
Pre-Trained Models: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models for gesture classification.
Custom Dataset Support: Train the model on specific sign language datasets for better accuracy.
Multi-Language Support: Capable of recognizing gestures across different sign language standards.
User-Friendly Output: Displays recognized signs as text or converts them to speech.


Tech Stack
Python: Programming language for development.
OpenCV: Real-time computer vision for video processing.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks for model training and inference.
MediaPipe: Efficient hand tracking for gesture recognition.


Applications
Assistive tools for hearing-impaired individuals.
Educational platforms for learning sign language.
Real-time communication in sign language.
